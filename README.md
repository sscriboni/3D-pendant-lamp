# 3D pendant lamp
 some 3D prject of pendant lamp using GU7 lamp

For the pendant I use an alluminium bar of 10 mm diameter (external)

top and bottom are the two frame of the lamp and or1_top and or2_bottom the two part of the sphere

to pass the wires outside the balls you need to make holes with a small drill
