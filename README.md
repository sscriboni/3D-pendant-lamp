# 3D pendant lamp

a 3D project including two pendant lamp using GU7 lamp, one with 3 lamps and a second with four (bigger)

For the pendant I use alluminium bars of 8 mm and 10 mm diameter (external misured)

## 4 lights lamp

All files beginning with 4L (four large)

* 4L-top-part (x 4) is the main part of the lamp, has to be printed 4 times and assembled with some glue, next you can use 4L-cover to cover the intersections
* 4L-top is the lamp support to fix to the ceiling with 2 or 4 screws
* 4L-pendant-1 (x 4) is the cover of the lamp
* 4L-pendant-2 (x 8) is half of the adapter used to bring the cover lamp to the alluminium bar
* 4L-adapter (x 4) is an optional adapter for 8 mm bar
* 4L-cover (x 4) is optional and it's used to cover the intersection of the plate wich is composed bay 4 parts

Pay attention that you have to do some wire connections to connect the GU7 lamp to the lamp.
